approximately 18 months.  Some time after the release of 3.12.0 final,
the ninth and final 3.11 bugfix update will be released.  After that,
it is expected that security updates (source only) will be released
until 5 years after the release of 3.11.0 final, so until approximately
October 2027.

Some of the notable features of Python 3.11 include:

PEP 654, Exception Groups and except*.
PEP 657, Enhanced error locations in tracebacks.
PEP 680, Support for parsing TOML in the standard library
Python 3.11 is up to 10-60% faster than Python 3.10. On average, we measured
a 1.25x speedup on the standard benchmark suite. See Faster CPython for
details.

PEP 646, Variadic generics.
PEP 655, Marking individual TypedDict items as required or potentially-missing.
