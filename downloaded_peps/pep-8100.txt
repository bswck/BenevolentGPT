Abstract
This document describes the schedule and other details of the January
2019 election for the Python steering council, as specified in
PEP 13. This is the first steering council election.


Returns officer
In future elections, the returns officer will be appointed by the
outgoing steering council. Since this is the first election, we have
no outgoing steering council, and PEP 13 says that the returns officer
is instead appointed by the PSF Executive Director, Ewa Jodlowska.
She appointed Ee Durbin.


Schedule
There will be a two-week nomination period, followed by a two-week
vote.
The nomination period is: January 7, 2019 through January 20, 2019
The voting period is: January 21, 2019 12:00 UTC through February 4, 2019 12:00
UTC (The end of February 3, 2019 Anywhere on Earth)
